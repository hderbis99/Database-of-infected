# Database-of-infected
This program is inspired by my passion for post-apo themes. This is a console program written in c# language.
The program uses the System.IO library. It allows us to write data to a file, read it, search for it, delete it, copy the entire file or delete the database.
The entire program runs in a loop so the user has the choice of terminating the work or continuing it.
